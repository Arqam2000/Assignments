    <p>Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival in China, Seollal in Korea, and Tết in Vietnam,
        marks the beginning of the lunar calendar. It starts with the year’s first new moon which, in 2023, is on
        January 22nd.</p>
    <p>While Lunar New Year is one of the most important holidays in China, it is also celebrated by more than 1 billion
        people worldwide each year! </p>

        <p>Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is a 15-day holiday during which people usher out the old year
            and look forward to the luck and prosperity of the new one. Young people are gifted money in bright red
            envelopes, and families get together to celebrate with a traditional dinner. </p>
        <p>The last event of Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. People carry glowing lanterns in a parade, and
            dancers perform a dance dressed in dragon costumes.</p>

        <p>In South Korea, Lunar New Year (called Seollal) is celebrated with family, and many people travel to their
            hometowns for the holiday. During this time, South Koreans dress in traditional clothing called hanbok, and
            children show respect to their elders with formal bows called seh bae, during which they kneel deeply with
            their hands on the ground and wish their elders good fortune in the new year. In return, elders gift
            children money in silk bags and share words of wisdom for the new year. Kids also play Yut Nori, a
            traditional board game with wooden sticks. </p>

        <p>Tết, the Vietnamese New Year, is the most important festival of the year in Vietnam. Unlike Chinese New Year,
            Tết is based on the lunisolar calendar (calculating both the motion of the Earth around the Sun and of the
            Moon around Earth). This means that it usually falls on the same day as Chinese New Year, but on some rare
            occasions, the two dates differ. In 2023, though, Tết and Chinese New Year are on the same day: January
            22nd. Tết also has a second key difference – it follows the Vietnamese Zodiac, which means that in Vietnam,
            2023 is the Year of the Cat, not the Rabbit! </p>
